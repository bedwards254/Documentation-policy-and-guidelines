# Revising Documentation Using GitHub

In order to make changes to Rose Library documentation stored using GitHub, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com). Choose a username and password, enter your email address, and click "Sign up for GitHub."

Once you have a GitHub account, an administrator for the Rose-CollectionServices account must add you as a collaborator to each Rose-CollectionServices repository that you wish to edit. Once added, you will receive an email inviting you to collaborate on the relevant repository. Accept this invitation and you are ready to begin editing.

Now that you a ready to begin editing, what is it that you wish to do?

## Tips for writing good commit messages

Commit messages are comprised of both a subject line and body. The subject line is required; the body can be used if additional detail is needed. Good commit messages should be pithy and descriptive. Keep the following guidelines in mind:

* Commit messages should describe **what** you did, not why or how. Be specific so that another contributor can easily identify your changes or additions
* **Keep it short:** Commit subject lines should be less than 50 characters. If necessary, include additional detail in the message body.
* **Use the present tense (and imperative mood):** "Correct pricing error" not "Corrected pricing error."
